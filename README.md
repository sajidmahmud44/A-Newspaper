# FirebaseAuth News â€” Newspaper Website

A simple, responsive newspaper website built as a learning project to practice and implement Firebase Authentication and the onAuthStateChanged listener.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
FirebaseAuth News is a front-end newspaper-style web app that allows users to:

Sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication (Email/Password or any method you implement)

Stay logged in using session persistence

React dynamically to authentication state changes using onAuthStateChanged

Access or restrict content based on authentication state

This project is focused more on auth workflows and real-time user state handling than content management.
